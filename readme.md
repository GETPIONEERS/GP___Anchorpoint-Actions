a few words on distributing actions via git:

1. We currently only support Github public repositories. The branch name does not matter

2. The menu only shows packaged actions. A package of actions is just another yaml file that describes and bundles multiple actions into one user facing package. "Loose" actions will still work, they will still show up in your context menus etc. Have a look at our documentation how to create your own package: https://docs.anchorpoint.app/docs/5-Actions/packages/packages/

3. if you want to debug your installed actions, Anchorpoint installs them to: C:/Users/YOUR_USER/Documents/Anchorpoint/actions/SOME_ID

Q:
Is it currently possible to set folder icons / colors via python action? The only thing remotely related in the documentation that I could find was changing dialog icon and color

A:
Hey, yes it's possible. I recently added this to the python API but did not yet manage to update the documentation.
Check how the git actions do it:

The fork from @mel has a nice overview of built-in icons:

But you also add a local file if you want
